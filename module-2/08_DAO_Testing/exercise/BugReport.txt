Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee()

Expected output: 2

Actual output: 1

How did you fix this bug?
Answer: I've changed the (if statement) to while loop and that fixed the bug.


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_with_valid_id_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project

Actual output: 2

How did you fix this bug?

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updateTimesheet_updates_timesheet

Expected output: false

Actual output: true

How did you fix this bug?
Answer: I've added (billable) to the sql query,
also added (timesheet.isbillabel()) to the (int rowsAffected) statement
and that fixed the bug.


Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

Expected output:
hours_worked 0.00
Actual output:
hours_worked 2.0

How did you fix this bug?
The hours_worked for employee_id 2 and project_id 2 should be 0.0 because it's not billable
so I've added (billable = true) to the sql query to check for billable hours.
